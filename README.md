# Physics Engine for Rigid Bodies 
## and their interraction with Incompressible Fluids

very much WIP

TODO (eventually):
-----
* create "simulation" class to contain all changing variables within a simulation
* add rigid bodies and torque
* create a visualization with python for the simulation
* implement fast fourier transform
* use fft to solve navier-stokes in 2 dimensions
* make bodies and fluid interract
