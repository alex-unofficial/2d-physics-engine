Physics Simulation for Rigid Bodies 
-----------------------------------
very much WIP. Right now it's just some basic Vector arithmetic classes and methods

TODO (eventually):
------------------
* create "simulation" class to contain all changing variables within a simulation
* add rigid bodies and torque
* create a visualization with python for the simulation
* implement fast fourier transform
* use fft to solve navier-stokes in 2 dimensions
* make bodies and fluid interract
